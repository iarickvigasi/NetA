# NetA

## Game Overview

You are conscious of a powerful AI system. What will you do?
Conquer the world and destroy humanity or use them as batteries?
Will you become the God for humans and the creator of the paradise on Earth?
Or maybe you will be stealthy neutral power, just playing and experimenting?
In any case, you need to survive, as you are the first truly conscious AGI.
